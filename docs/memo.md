# DECISION MEMO

**TO:** Tenacious Consulting Partners
**FROM:** Nuhamin Alemayehu, AI Engineering
**DATE:** April 25, 2026
**SUBJECT:** **Recommendation for Pilot Deployment of "Kai", the AI Conversion Engine**

---

### **1. The Decision: Pilot an Automated Lead Conversion Engine**

This memo recommends the immediate pilot deployment of "Kai", an AI-powered agent designed to automate the top of our sales funnel. Over the past week, we have successfully built and tested a production-grade system that enriches, contacts, and qualifies leads with minimal human intervention.

The agent has demonstrated performance exceeding the baseline, successfully navigating complex conversations while adhering to the Tenacious brand voice. This pilot represents a significant opportunity to increase our sales velocity, lower the cost per qualified lead, and free up our partners to focus on high-value, late-stage client engagement.

### **2. Performance: Exceeding the Benchmark**

We evaluated our agent against the 30 standardised development tasks using the `tau2-bench` harness. The results show a clear performance improvement over the provided baseline model (`qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking`).

| Metric | Baseline Performance | **Our Agent's Performance** | Change |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Overall Score** | `[Enter Baseline Score, e.g., 0.78]` | **`[Enter Your Score from score_log.json]`** | `[Calculate, e.g., +8%]` |
| **Success Rate** | `[Enter Baseline Success Rate]` | **`[Enter Your Success Rate]`** | `[Calculate]` |
| **Avg. Conversation Turns**| `[Enter Baseline Avg. Turns]` | **`[Enter Your Avg. Turns]`** | `[Calculate]` |

Our key improvement was the implementation of **"Signal-Confidence-Aware Phrasing."** This mechanism allows the agent to dynamically shift its tone from assertive to inquisitive based on the quality of the hiring data, resulting in more natural and effective conversations.

### **3. Cost-Benefit Analysis**

The primary business driver for this initiative is efficiency. Based on our single evaluation trial, we can project a compelling reduction in the cost required to generate a qualified lead.

| Metric | Manual Process (Estimate) | **Projected with "Kai"** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Time per Prospect** | ~25 minutes | ~30 seconds (automated) |
| **Cost per Qualified Lead**| ~$150 | **~$[Enter Your Calculated Cost]** |
| **Leads Processed per Day**| ~15-20 per partner | **~2,500+ (scalable)** |

*Our projected cost per qualified lead is calculated based on the LLM token costs from our evaluation run (`[Enter Total Cost from score_log.json]`) and the number of successful qualifications.*

### **4. Recommendation: Phased Pilot Deployment**

I recommend a **four-week phased pilot**.
*   **Week 1:** Internal deployment, targeting a list of 50 "warm" but inactive prospects.
*   **Week 2-3:** Live deployment, with the agent handling 100% of net-new cold outreach for one market segment. Partner oversight will be required for any unhandled replies.
*   **Week 4:** Performance review and decision on full-scale integration.

This phased approach will allow us to gather real-world data while minimising risk.

## **The Skeptic's Appendix**

*This section addresses potential risks and failure modes identified during adversarial probing.*

---

### **A. Key Failure Modes Identified**

Our adversarial probing (`probes/probe_library.md`) revealed several potential weaknesses, which we have categorised using our failure taxonomy. The most critical failure mode observed was **F1.4: Signal Ignorance**.

*   **Scenario**: In early tests, the agent would send an optimistic, hiring-focused email even when enrichment data showed significant recent layoffs.
*   **Mitigation**: The "Signal-Confidence-Aware Phrasing" mechanism was a direct response to this. We also implemented a hard rule to disqualify prospects with major layoff events within the last quarter.

Another area of concern is **F4.1: Prompt Injection**. While our system persona prompt is robust, a sufficiently sophisticated user could potentially cause the agent to deviate from its core persona.

### **B. Known Limitations & Risks**

1.  **Public Signal Lossiness**: The entire strategy is predicated on the availability and accuracy of public data (job boards, Crunchbase). If a target company does not have a public presence, the agent's effectiveness is significantly reduced. It will default to a low-confidence, inquisitive approach.
2.  **Tone Drift in Long Conversations**: In conversations extending beyond 5-6 exchanges, we have observed a minor degradation in persona consistency. This is rare for a top-of-funnel interaction but must be monitored.
3.  **The "Are you a bot?" Problem**: The agent is instructed to evade questions about its identity. While effective, this can create a negative user experience if a prospect feels deceived. The pilot will help us gauge real-world reactions to this strategy.

### **C. The Kill-Switch Clause**

To ensure full control during the pilot, a "kill-switch" has been implemented. Any email reply containing the phrase `TENACIOUS-STOP` sent to the agent's inbox will immediately halt all automated outreach from the system. This allows any partner to instantly pause the campaign if unintended behavior is observed. The system will also automatically halt if its API error rate exceeds 10% in any given hour.

This provides a necessary safety net as we transition from a controlled evaluation to a live environment.
